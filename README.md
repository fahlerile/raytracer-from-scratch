# raytracer-from-scratch

A raytracer.

## TODO
New features
- [x] Add basic raytracing for a sphere (probably should delete `Object` for now, just `Sphere`, because there is no other primitives for now)
- [ ] Camera looks in the wrong direction?
- [ ] Add light
    - [ ] Diffuse Reflection (matte)
    - [ ] Specular Reflection (shiny)
    - [ ] Colored light (need to have multiple light intensities)
- [ ] Add shadows
- [ ] Add reflections
- [ ] Add other primitives

Bugfixes/improvements
- [ ] `Scene::cast_ray` bug (see comment there)
