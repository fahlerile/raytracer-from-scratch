# raytracer-from-scratch

A raytracer, which uses left-hand coordinate system, and in which camera looks in `+Z` direction by default. Visualization of the simple scene I made in GeoGebra: https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/zfexqajh

## TODO/NOTES
New features
- [ ] Add reflections
- [ ] Add other primitives
    - [ ] Planes
    - [ ] Mathematical functions (???)
    - [ ] Cylinder
    - [ ] Cone
    - [ ] Torus
    - [ ] Polygon
- [ ] Camera transform (camera matrix)

Potential bug causes
- [ ] `alpha` parameter is changing during `color_t` arithmetic (should it?)
